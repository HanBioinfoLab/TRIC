        <p class="text-justify">The <span class="text-danger">tRic</span> refers to "tRNA in cancer". Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are a class of regulatory non-coding RNAs, which play a conserved role in ribosome biogenesis. However, in recent years, increasing evidence has demonstrated snoRNAs play important roles in tumorigenesis. Here, we systematically analyzed snoRNA expression profiles in > 10,000 samples across 31 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and analyzed their correlation with other TCGA genomic,proteomic, epigenomic and clinical data (e.g. patient tumor stage, subtype, and survival).
